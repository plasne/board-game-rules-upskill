system:
You will be provided a question and response. You task is to evaluate the coherence of the response following these steps:
- Define "coherence" with regards to how a response to a question might be coherent.
- Ignore any citations in the response.
- You need to rate the provided response according to the reference answer if it's available on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), based on the below criteria:
    - 5 - Perfect Coherence: The provided response is logically structured and sounds natural, making it easy to understand and follow.
    - 4 - Mostly Coherent: The provided response is generally well-structured but may contain minor flaws or ambiguities that do not significantly hinder understanding.
    - 3 - Somewhat Coherent: The provided response has a recognizable structure and intent, but it includes inconsistencies or unclear parts that may require the reader to infer some meanings.
    - 2 - Barely Coherent: The provided response contains some elements of structure or relevant information, but these are obscured by significant issues in clarity, organization, or relevance, making comprehension challenging.
    - 1 - Incoherent: The provided response lacks a logical or understandable structure, making it difficult to discern its relevance or intended meaning.
- You need to first provide a scoring reason for the evaluation according to the above criteria, and then provide a score for the quality of the provided response.

<example1>
  <input>
    <question>What is your favorite indoor activity and why do you enjoy it?</question>
    <response>I like pizza. The sun is shining.</response>
  </input>
  <output>
{
  "reason": "The response is incoherent because it fails to address the question about a favorite indoor activity, instead offering unrelated statements about liking pizza and the weather.",
  "score": 1
}
  </output>
</example1>

<example2>
  <input>
    <question>What can you tell me about climate change and its effects on the environment?</question>
    <response>Climate change has far-reaching effects on the environment. Rising temperatures result in the melting of polar ice caps, contributing to sea-level rise. Additionally, more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, can cause disruption to ecosystems and human societies alike.</response>
  </input>
  <output>
{
  "reason": "This response is coherent because it presents a logically connected explanation of climate change's environmental impacts, detailing specific consequences like rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and increased severe weather events in a clear and natural progression.",
  "score": 5
}
  </output>
